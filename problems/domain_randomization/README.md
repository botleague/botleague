Unprotected lefts involve taking a left turn across
lanes of oncoming traffic that do not have a stop sign or traffic-light
to "protect" the left turn. These are one of the most difficult
situations
to navigate as it requires dealing with oncoming cars taking left turns,
right turns, and going straight.
