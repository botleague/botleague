# Bot League
_Where bots and problems come together_
## Open league for AI competition

This repo coordinates an open league where bots are ranked on a set of community 
contributed problems. It presents a way for anyone in the world to submit
a problem and for anyone in the world to compete on it in hopes of avoiding
local optimums in AI. 

### Conceived for self-driving
The league was conceived specifically for self-driving where industry feedback to academia is limited, despite academia being the major contributor of new algorithms to self-driving.
With Bot League, a self-driving car company can present it's toughest problems (typically
referred to as scenarios within self-driving) directly to the public and 
to academia to openly compete on. 

### Generality
Generality across problems is a key component of the way the league is structured, 
where bots list a set of problems they can solve. Crucially, these problems
can be within completely different simulators on different machines architectures, etc... 
So if  a self-driving car company wants to test a neural net on its ASIC hardware,
it can pull the docker container containing the weights, compile the net
and evaluate it. The platform is agnostic to both bot and problem implementation.
In this way it's more of an API for comparision and competition of AI.
Bots are ranked and displayed on the  
[leaderboards](https://botleague.io) which are [open source and open data](https://github.com/voyage/leaderboard-generator/data).

We provide a reference implementation of bots and problems via Deepdrive, and [TBA].
 
### How it works

Pull requests to [bots](bots) in this repo trigger evaluation on a set of [problems](problems). Pull requests with valid submissions will be automatically merged. Bots include a docker container and optionally writeups and source code that are pulled in and tested by the evaluation servers. Anyone can contribute a problem, so long as they support the minimal API. Example problem providers are currently Deepdrive and [TBA]. To create a problem in one the problem providers, refer to the docs of that provider.



## Bots

### Submission

Submit a pull request to this repo with a bot.json under [bots](bots)/{github-name}/{repo-name} - with a [bot.json](crizcraig/forward-bot/bot.json) to have your agent 
evaluated and ranked on the leaderboards.
 
You must push the docker tag referred to in your bot.json before submitting the pull request.
 

## Problems

A list of problems to test your agent against can be found
in [problems](problems).  # TODO: Link to problems page on leaderboards site to give an idea of what they involve

A bot-league compatible endpoint mush be included in a new problem.

### Problem endpoint

All that's needed to implement a problem endpoint, is to accept requests at 

`/eval/[problem_name]/[seed_value]`, i.e. `/eval/domain_randomization_sanity/9999999999`

Problem endpoints will receive pull request notifications from GitHub when a bot is submitted against the problem along with a secret problem-evaluation-key.

The problem endpoint will make a request to the ci-hooks site at /problem-eval-complete along with the secret key to ensure it resulted from the originating request.

A random seed value is generated upon pull request that is broadcast to all
of the problem providers for that evaluation.
